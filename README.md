## Data arrangement 
We save the pushes for each object individually. 

- There are 6 folders, each folder contains 9~10 zip files. totally there are 59 zip files.
- After downloading and unziping the zip file, you should get a folder, which is arranged as:
- sf1
    - com1
        - cf1i1w
        - cf2i1w
        - cf1i2w
        - cf2i2w
    - com2
        - cf1i1w

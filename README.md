Here is the google drive link to SimPush Dataset : https://bit.ly/2O8Y4Iq
##Data arrangement
We save the pushes for each object individually.
There are 6 folders, each folder contains 9~10 zip files.
After downloading and unziping the zip file, you should get a folder, which is arranged as:
Surface Friction
  COM
    Contact Friction
      Inertia
        Weight

Python scripts for reading, propcessing, and visualizing data will come soon!
